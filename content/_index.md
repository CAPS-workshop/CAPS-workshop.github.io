## Workshop on Computer-Aided Proofs of Security

Interested in this formal verification thing everyone talks about, but no clue where to start? EasyCrypt, Proverif, Lean, aren't they all the same? Why are there so many tools when one should be enough? CAPS will give you an overview of the formal verification tool landscape for cryptographic security, for primitives and protocols, and from symbolic to computational security and everything in between.
