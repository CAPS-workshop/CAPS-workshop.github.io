title: CAPS'25 Workshop

## Workshop on Computer-Aided Proofs of Security - Sunday May 4th 2025

Interested in this formal verification thing everyone talks about, but no
clue where to start? EasyCrypt, Proverif, Lean, aren't they all the same? Why
are there so many tools when one should be enough? CAPS will give you an
overview of the formal verification tool landscape for cryptographic
security, for primitives and protocols, and from symbolic to computational
security and everything in between.

The workshop's aim is to give cryptographers an overview of the current tool
landscape around cryptographic security proofs, from the perspective of how
*they* would interact with the tools. More generally, we hope to bring
together researchers and practitioners in cryptography and formal methods
that are interested in computer-aided security proofs.
