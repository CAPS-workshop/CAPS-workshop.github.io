## Workshop on Computer-Aided Proofs of Security

Interested in this formal verification thing everyone talks about, but no clue where to start? EasyCrypt, Proverif, Lean, aren't they all the same? Why are there so many tools when one should be enough? CAPS will give you an overview of the formal verification tool landscape for cryptographic security, for primitives and protocols, and from symbolic to computational security and everything in between.

The workshop's aim is to give cryptographers an overview of the current tool landscape around cryptographic security proofs, from the perspective of how *they* would interact with the tools. More generally, we hope to bring together researchers and practitioners in cryptography and formal methods that are interested in computer-aided security proofs.

## Preliminary Program

The program is still ðŸš§ under construction ðŸš§ and will be updated with more detail shortly.

We have confirmed speakers presenting
- [EasyCrypt](https://www.easycrypt.info/)
- [Tamarin](https://tamarin-prover.com/)
- [ProVerif](https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/)
- [ProofFrog](https://prooffrog.github.io/)
- ðŸš§ and more to come ðŸš§

## Practical Information

CAPS'25 will be held in Madrid, Spain, on Sunday, May 4., as a [Eurocrypt 2025](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2025/) affiliated event. Please register through the Eurocrypt 2025 [website](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2025/registration.php) by selecting CAPS as your "workshop day 2" event.

If you are exicted about CAPS, the [ProTeCS workshop](https://protecs-workshop.gitlab.io/) may also interest you. It provides a less verification-focused take on cryptographic proofs on the day before CAPS.

## Organizers
